    <blockquote>Showcasing the talent of 33 artists, many of whom are local to the Chicagoland area, NO COLOR challenges conventional notions of artistic expression by exploring the limitless possibilities that emerge when black and white intersect. By removing color from the equation, artists are compelled to explore alternative avenues of communication and expression, leading to unexpected and compelling outcomes.</blockquote>

    <h3>CHICAGO WORKS: A Captivating Art Exhibition by <a href="https://j2gallery.com">Jackson Junge Gallery</a></h3>

    </div>

    <blockquote>Far from romanticizing the city, this exhibition seeks to unveil the raw grittiness of Chicago's lived experience while nurturing a profound admiration and appreciation for its familiar aspects. In his artwork titled "Bearing the Elements”, Kevin Nadro captures the chaos and anxiety of traversing the city amidst never-ending construction. He remarks, "As I walk around my neighborhood of Wicker Park the improvements made to the infrastructure put a strain on small sidewalks and streets. Where are you supposed to park several large trucks on a residential street? The noise, detours, and space are apparent to all". One might smile as they read this description, knowing full well the pain of trying to find parking while construction is underway. And should we even mention wintertime “dibs” law?</blockquote>
